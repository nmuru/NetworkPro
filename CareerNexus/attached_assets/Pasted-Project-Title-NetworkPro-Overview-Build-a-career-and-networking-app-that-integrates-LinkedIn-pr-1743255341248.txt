Project Title: NetworkPro

Overview
Build a career and networking app that integrates LinkedIn profile data. The app should allow users to upload their LinkedIn profile as a PDF (instead of OAuth authentication for now) and extract relevant details to provide personalized career and networking recommendations.

Core Features:
Profile Extraction: Users will upload their LinkedIn profile as a PDF, and the app will extract key details such as name, headline, location, current job title, company, industry, education, skills, and certifications.

Top 5 Recommendations:

- Users to Follow (based on industry, interests, and mutual connections)

- People to Connect With (colleagues, alumni, influencers)

- Jobs to Apply For (based on skills and career goals)

- Courses to Learn (recommended for skill improvement)

- Skills to Develop (aligned with job market trends)

Refreshing & Storing Recommendations: Users can refresh recommendations and store selected suggestions in persistent storage.

Tab-Based Navigation: The app should have four main tabs:

Home – Displays extracted LinkedIn profile data

Career Interests – AI-powered suggestions based on profile data

Networking – Recommended connections, posts, and experts

Jobs – Job openings, recruiters, courses, and skill suggestions
